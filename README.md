<@Yas, please add info about this here>

## Setup

This project has the a few basic package requirements, which can be installed as follows:

```bash
pip install requests qiskit streamlit
```

Alternately, use the corresponding install commands for your package manager of choice.

To run the `streamlit` server, run the following in the project directory:

```bash
streamlit run news_search.py
```

Then, in your browser, open the webapp on the port specified by `streamlit`, e.g., `http://localhost:8501`.

Follow the web interface to use our project! Alternatively, take a look at our Jupyter notebook (`news_search.ipynb`) for a static demonstration.
